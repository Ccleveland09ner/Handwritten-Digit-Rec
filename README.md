# ðŸ§  Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project implements a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It leverages TensorFlow and Keras to build, train, and evaluate a simple yet effective model for digit classification.

##  Features

- Trains on the MNIST dataset of 60,000 handwritten digits
- Uses a fully connected neural network with ReLU activations
- Evaluates model accuracy on a 10,000-image test set
- Visualizes training performance with loss and accuracy plots

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then install the required packages:
torch
torchvision
matplotlib
